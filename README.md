# ISI_QGIS

This is the GIT repository for templates to be used for Infographics e.t.c.

## Purpose
This repository contains the strucutre and code to facilitate report writing using QGIS. The templates are created as combinations of items to be added to the template.

## Usage
TBC

## ToDo
- [ ] Write python code to link a reference point to the coordinates field in the layout
- [ ] Write python code (or other) to generate a desired layout that combines the various modular elements. The idea will be that the main analysis text can be provided as markdown (latex ?) for inclusion in the layout
- [ ] Write python code that autogenerates the copyright sensor information from data contained in the map
- [ ] Complete the above in a QGIS plugin
- [ ] Investigate geopdf limitations (CRS, rotation, e.t.c.)
- [ ] Generate templates and template objects for all styles of template. Templates have been labelled East for imagery on the east side of the template, North for imagery on the north side of the template and Central for no text outside the map frame of the layout
